# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Security filter: SQL detector false positives on natural text** (`plugins/security/core/injection_detectors.py`). The pattern `r'--\s'` triggered on legitimate user input such as email visual separators (`----------`), RFC 3676 signature delimiters (`-- \n`), em-dashes in prose and dash-separated enumerations. Chat messages containing any of these returned HTTP 400 "SQL detected" at `/ui/chat`. Replaced with `r'[\'"]\s*--'`, which only matches the quote-dashdash signature of real SQL comment injection attacks. All 5 real SQL attacks in `test_real_attacks_still_blocked` remain blocked via other patterns. 4 regression tests added covering the natural-text cases.
- **UI: LaTeX math notation in chat output** (`plugins/web_ui_module/core/latex_sanitizer.py`, `plugins/web_ui_module/api/routes_chat.py`, `personality/server.toml`). Some models (notably Gemma-4-31B-8bit) emit LaTeX like `$\rightarrow$`, `$\times 2$`, `$\sqrt{x}$` and `\pi` in normal chat answers; the web UI renders Markdown via `marked.js` with no LaTeX engine, so users saw literal strings. Fixed server-side at the streaming boundary so web UI + future clients all benefit, without shipping KaTeX or any JS dependency. New `latex_to_unicode()` (two-pass inline-span + bare-command substitution, ~35 commands covered) and `LatexStreamBuffer` for chunked streams (retains trailing incomplete `\letters` and unclosed `$` so tokens split across chunks are reassembled before substitution). Currency (`$24.50`), shell variables (`$HOME`) and bare dollars survive untouched. FORMAT instruction added to all 6 system prompts (ca/es/en × small/full). 35 new pytest cases.
- **Session manager: double-init race hid encrypted sessions and silently wrote unencrypted ones** (`plugins/web_ui_module/module.py`, `plugins/web_ui_module/api/routes.py`). `WebUIModule.__init__` created a `SessionManager()` without crypto before `initialize()` could build the real one with the `crypto_provider`. The loader (`core/loader/manifest_base._get_module`) then called `instance._init_router()` immediately after `__init__`, and `create_router()` captured `session_mgr = module_instance.session_manager` into a local — snapshotting the crypto-less manager. Later `initialize()` replaced `self.session_manager` with an encrypted manager that had correctly loaded all `.enc` files, but the router routes still pointed at the original. Consequences: the web UI only listed `.json` sessions (`.enc` invisible though decryptable), new sessions were persisted unencrypted, and a reboot's `.json → .enc` migration could overwrite existing `.enc` files belonging to a different conversation with the same session id (collision observed in the wild). Fixed with a `_SessionManagerProxy` that re-reads `module_instance.session_manager` on every attribute access (late-binding), and a single `SessionManager(crypto_provider=crypto)` construction in `initialize()` (the placeholder in `__init__` was removed). Result: one real SessionManager per plugin life, routes always see it, encrypted sessions visible, new sessions written `.enc`.

## [1.0.1-beta] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Linux ARM64 support** documented (tested via UTM, Ubuntu 24.04).
- **Installer: bundled Ollama offline** + fixed model tier threshold.
- **Memory: delete confirmation flow**, atomic fact splitter, VLM role fixes.

### Fixed

- **Installer (Linux)**: copy to `~/.local/share/nexe/` when source is Downloads dir (avoids permission issues).

### Changed

- Dependency security bumps from gitoss sync: `fastapi`, `python-multipart`, `pytest`.
- Version metadata bumped from `1.0.0-beta` to `1.0.1-beta` (pyproject, personality/server.toml, READMEs, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, installer Info.plist, knowledge base).
- Plugin-owned versions (`plugins/*/manifest.toml` and `plugins/*/module.py`) untouched: plugins follow their own release cycle (version = codi introduït), independent of product bumps.

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2026-04-16

### Summary

First public pre-1.0 release. Confidence bump from `0.9.9` after the final documentation coherence audit — no functional code changes beyond what `0.9.9` already shipped. The project is now considered a **minimum viable product for the real world**, open to community feedback.

### Changed

- Version metadata bumped to `1.0.0-beta` across the codebase (pyproject, plugins, installer, knowledge base).
- Knowledge base consolidated (13 thematic documents × 3 languages = 39 files), with Table of Contents and "In 30 seconds" quick intros added to user-facing docs (IDENTITY, INSTALLATION, USAGE, RAG).
- New document: `USE_CASES.md` (ca/en/es) covering 6 practical use cases and "when server-nexe is NOT the best tool".
- New section: `ERRORS.md` "How to report an error" with privacy warning for logs.
- Honest coverage figure (~85%) replaces inflated historical badges (97.4%/91.1%/93%).
- Security audits attribution expanded: Claude + Gemini + Codex + cross-model reviews (not just Claude).
- `AI collaboration` credit in author metadata: `"Jordi Goy with AI collaboration"`.
- Stripe / Ko-fi / GitHub Sponsors URLs corrected (Ko-fi was wrong: `/jgoylabs` → `/servernexe`).
- Root READMEs synchronised across CA/EN/ES with screenshots (`.github/screenshots/`) and the "giant spaghetti monster → minimal core" story framing.

### Unchanged (still true from 0.9.9)

- All functional fixes from 0.9.9 remain (Bug #18 MEM_DELETE, Bug #19 crypto/memory/session/installer, offline install 100%, macOS 14+ Apple Silicon target, `llama-cpp-python==0.3.19` pin).
- 4842 tests collected, ~85% global coverage.

### Known limits

- AI-only audits: no external human security audit yet.
- Single-user by design.
- Community feedback welcome via GitHub Issues and the forum at `server-nexe.com`.

## [0.9.9] - 2026-04-16

Pre-release consolidated: Bug #18 MEM_DELETE cirurgia + Bug #19 (4 sub-bugs) + offline-install bundle + Apple Silicon / macOS 14 narrowing + thinking toggle. Last P0 blockers closed before v1.0.

### Security

- **RAG injection via memory tags (#18 P0)**: `_filter_rag_injection` now
  neutralizes `[MEM_DELETE:…]`, `[MEM_SAVE:…]`, `[OLVIDA|OBLIT|FORGET:…]`
  and `[MEMORIA:…]` at ingest time (ingest_docs, ingest_knowledge) and at
  retrieval time (`_sanitize_rag_context`). Previously a malicious document
  could embed a MEM_DELETE tag in its body; the LLM would copy it verbatim
  into its response and the pipeline would execute the delete. Now every
  such tag becomes `[FILTERED]` before the model ever sees it. 4 new tests
  in `test_rag_sanitization.py`.

### Added

- **E2E integration tests for MEM_DELETE (#18 P0)**: new
  `tests/integration/test_mem_delete_e2e.py` with 8 tests against a real
  Qdrant (embedded, tmp_path) + real fastembed embedder. Covers the full
  save/list/delete/list-empty cycle, short-query-vs-long-stored matching
  under the 0.20 threshold, unrelated-fact survival guard, clear_memory
  wipe + safety rail, and RAG injection neutralization end-to-end.
  Closes the empirical gap flagged by BUS v0.9.0 feedback ("mocks enganyen").
  Marker `@pytest.mark.integration` — excluded from the default fast
  suite, run explicitly.
- **Thinking toggle endpoint**: `PATCH /session/{id}/thinking` (HOMAD,
  rate-limited at 10/min) lets the UI flip `<think>` output on/off per
  session. Backed by a `THINKING_CAPABLE` family safelist (qwen3.5,
  qwen3, qwq, deepseek-r1, gemma3/4, llama4, gpt-oss) and a `can_think(model)`
  helper; default is OFF, with a 400-retry fallback if the backend
  refuses. UI adds the ✨ sparkles toggle + 🧠 model dropdown. New
  env var `NEXE_OLLAMA_THINK`.
- `installer/build-wheels-bundle.sh` — pre-downloads all Python wheels
  (`--only-binary=:all:` for `macosx_14_0_arm64` + `cp312`) into
  `InstallNexe.app/Contents/Resources/wheels/`. Validates critical wheels
  are present and the total size is in range.
- `installer/build-embedding-bundle.sh` — uses a temporary venv with
  fastembed to pre-download the default multilingual embedding model into
  `InstallNexe.app/Contents/Resources/embeddings/`. Validates the ONNX +
  tokenizer + config artefacts are present.
- `build_dmg.sh` Step 5a/5b: orchestrates both new scripts before codesign
  and validates bundle sizes (exit code 14 on failure).
- Four new helpers in `installer/installer_setup_env.py`:
  `_find_bundle_resources`, `_write_venv_pip_conf`, `_seed_fastembed_cache`,
  `_default_fastembed_cache_dir`.
- Regression guards that grep `installer_setup_env.py` and
  `plugins/llama_cpp_module/module.py` for `CMAKE_ARGS` — fail the test
  suite if the flag is ever reintroduced.
- 40+ new tests across `test_installer_build_wheels.py`,
  `test_installer_build_embedding.py`, `test_installer_build_dmg.py`, and
  new classes in `test_installer_setup_env.py`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING — Apple Silicon only, macOS 14 Sonoma+**. The installer
  target narrows to Apple Silicon (arm64). Intel Macs and macOS 13
  Ventura are no longer supported. Knowledge base updated in ca/es/en.
- **Offline install: all Python wheels + embedding model bundled in the DMG**.
  The installer no longer downloads anything from PyPI or HuggingFace at
  install time. DMG size goes from ~20 MB to **~1.2 GB** (wheels + the
  fastembed multilingual model). On the client, the venv's `pip.conf` is
  configured with `find-links=<wheels>` and `no-index=true` so
  `pip install -r requirements.txt` uses only bundled wheels, and the
  fastembed cache is seeded from the bundled embedding model so
  `install.py` finds it already present. Root cause fixed: clean M1
  installs previously triggered the Xcode Command Line Tools prompt because
  `CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_METAL=on"` forced a `llama-cpp-python` source build
  even though the PyPI arm64 macOS wheel already ships with Metal. The
  installer now drops `CMAKE_ARGS` entirely. See
  `installer/build-wheels-bundle.sh`, `installer/build-embedding-bundle.sh`,
  and the `--skip-bundles` flag on `build_dmg.sh` for dev iteration.
- **`llama-cpp-python` pinned to `0.3.19`**. The `0.3.20` arm64 macOS
  wheel on PyPI is corrupted (Bad CRC-32) and fails to install from a
  clean venv. Pin held until upstream republishes a valid wheel.
- **Ollama `keep_alive: 0` on model switch (#14)**. When the UI switches
  models, the previous model is now unloaded explicitly so the new one
  gets VRAM immediately instead of waiting for Ollama's default TTL.
- **Image-attached prompt priority**. The internal `[IMATGE ADJUNTA]`
  marker makes the attached image take precedence over RAG snippets in
  the prompt, so multimodal backends see the picture instead of stale
  retrieval context.
- **Model catalog final layout**: 16 models across 4 tiers (8 / 16 / 24 /
  32 GB). The 64 GB tier is removed; Salamandra 2B, Qwen3.5 2B,
  Phi-4-mini, Llama 3.2 3B, Llama 4 Scout/Maverick, Mixtral, Mistral 7B,
  Qwen2.5 32B, QwQ 32B and GPT-OSS 120B are dropped from the catalog.

### Fixed

- **"Oblida tot" no longer arbitrarily deletes random facts (#18 P0)**:
  previously `detect_intent("Oblida tot")` returned `('delete', 'tot')`,
  which semantic-searched "tot" and deleted ~5 random facts similar to
  that token. Added explicit `CLEAR_ALL_TRIGGERS` (ca/es/en) checked
  **before** delete triggers, with a new `clear_all` intent. The pipeline
  arms a 2-turn confirmation (`session._pending_clear_all`) — the user
  must answer `sí, esborra-ho tot` / `yes delete everything` / `confirmo`
  / `go ahead` to actually wipe. Any other reply cancels and falls through
  as normal chat. Cables through to the previously-orphaned
  `clear_memory(confirm=True)`.
- **DELETE_THRESHOLD 0.70 → 0.20 (#18 P0)**: empirical finding from the
  new e2e integration suite — fastembed + paraphrase-multilingual scored
  even verbatim queries below 0.55. With the old 0.70 threshold, realistic
  flows like `save "L'usuari es diu Jordi i viu a Barcelona"` →
  `delete "em dic Jordi"` silently returned 0 matches and the fact was
  never deleted. 0.20 guarantees the forget actually forgets; occasional
  over-match on loosely related facts accepted as the better UX tradeoff
  for a "forget" primitive.
- **Bug #19a (P0) — personal_memory no longer wipes on restart.** The
  MemoryAPI singleton init previously contained a `delete_collection +
  create_collection` branch that fired whenever the Qdrant-reported vector
  size for `personal_memory` or `user_knowledge` did not match
  `DEFAULT_VECTOR_SIZE` (768). A transient `qdrant_client` anomaly or local
  storage corruption could cause the read to return a wrong size and
  silently wipe every saved memory. `DEFAULT_VECTOR_SIZE` is the single
  source of truth and nothing in the normal runtime path produces a
  different size, so the defensive branch was removed. If a real mismatch
  ever appears, Qdrant now surfaces a clear error at the next upsert rather
  than destroying user data.
- **Bug #19b (P0) — encrypted sessions (`.enc`) survive Keychain resets.**
  The Master Encryption Key (MEK) fallback chain is reordered to
  **file → keyring → env → generate**, and the file at `~/.nexe/master.key`
  (mode 0o600) is now written on every generation AND synced from the
  keyring when only the keyring has a key. Autonomous agents that reboot
  after a macOS upgrade, Keychain reset, or sandbox change keep their
  historical sessions and SQLCipher data readable. Atomic temp-file
  writes now use `tempfile.mkstemp` (unique name per call) to avoid
  collisions between concurrent in-process sync calls.
- **Bug #19c (P1) — images persisted with chat messages.**
  `ChatSession.add_message` now accepts an optional `image_b64` argument
  and stores it alongside the message text. On reload, attached images
  reappear inline in the UI. The field is emitted in the serialised JSON
  only when a value is present, preserving backward compatibility with
  existing session files. Corrupted `.enc` files now log at ERROR level
  (they represent invisible user data) and `SessionManager` exposes
  `corrupted_sessions_count` for health checks.
- **Bug #19d — single Nexe.app installation.** The installer no longer
  duplicates `Nexe.app` to `/Applications/Nexe.app`. The bundle lives
  only at `<install_dir>/Nexe.app` (next to `venv/`, so the Swift
  launcher resolves paths locally without relying on a marker file).
  Dock and Login Items now target the install-dir bundle. Legacy
  `/Applications/Nexe.app` left behind by earlier installs is removed
  at install time, with a guard against accidental self-deletion when
  `install_path == /Applications`.

### Removed

- `CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_METAL=on"` block + try/except fallback in
  `installer_setup_env.py` (caused the CLT prompt on clean M1).
- Unused `print_warn` import in `installer_setup_env.py`.
- `CMAKE_ARGS=...` suggestion in the error message of
  `plugins/llama_cpp_module/module.py` (obsolete advice that would
  re-trigger the same CLT prompt if a user followed it).

## [0.9.8] - 2026-04-15

Robust VLM detection + mlx-vlm 0.4 API port + installer / KB updates.

### Fixed

- **MLX VLM detection (silent degrade)**: `_detect_vlm_capability()` now combines
  three any-of signals: `architectures[]` (expanded set with Qwen2_5_VL, Qwen3VL,
  Qwen3_5Moe, Gemma4, LlavaOnevision, InternVL2, MiniCPMV, Idefics3, Mllama),
  `vision_config` presence, and `model.safetensors.index.json` weight map keys
  (`vision_tower`, `vision_model`, `visual.`, `mm_projector`, `image_newline`,
  `patch_embed`). Previously unknown VLM architectures fell through to `mlx_lm`
  and dumped 333 unmatched tensor names to the UI (Qwen3.5-MoE case).
- **_generate_vlm ported to mlx-vlm ≥ 0.4**: (1) `image=` now expects str path or
  List[str], not PIL.Image — incoming bytes are written to a NamedTemporaryFile
  and its path is passed (cleanup in `finally`). (2) `generate()` returns a
  `GenerationResult` dataclass, not raw str — we extract `.text` and map real
  metrics (`prompt_tokens`, `generation_tokens`, `prompt_tps`, `generation_tps`,
  `peak_memory`) into the response dict. Legacy str-result fallback kept.
- **llama_cpp VLM passthrough (BUG #9)**: images were extracted in `execute()` but never
  passed to `_generate()`/`_generate_streaming()`. Added VLM bifurcation with dedicated
  `_generate_vlm()`/`_generate_vlm_streaming()` methods (consistent with MLX pattern).
  Images encoded as base64 data URIs in OpenAI-compatible message format.
- **Versions hardcoded (BUG #10)**: 16+ locations had stale 0.9.0/0.9.1/1.0.0 strings.
  Created `core/version.py` (reads from `pyproject.toml` via `tomllib`) as single source
  of truth. All Python files now import `__version__`; Info.plist updated to 0.9.7.
- **Readiness check (P0)**: `ollama_module`, `mlx_module`, `llama_cpp_module` now return
  `DEGRADED` (not `UNHEALTHY`) when the LLM backend is unavailable (Ollama not running,
  model not loaded). The Web UI was blocked at "Iniciant..." on fresh installs because
  `UNHEALTHY` caused the overall readiness to fail; `DEGRADED` unblocks the UI.
- **Wizard: default install folder** now `/Applications/server-nexe` (was `~/server-nexe`).
- **Wizard: models show RAM (ram_gb)** instead of disk size (disk_gb) in model cards.
- **Wizard: tier selector (RAM tabs)** now centered (removed `minWidth: 640` ScrollView).
- **Wizard: "Obrir Nexe" button** shows a 10-second countdown with tray explanation before
  launching. Eliminates the screen flash caused by `killall Dock` at click time.
- **Dock icon "?"**: `doAddToDock()` now uses the actual install path (`engine.installPath`)
  instead of hardcoded `/Applications/Nexe.app`. Fixes broken Dock entry on non-standard paths.
- **Login item path** (`doAddLoginItem`) also fixed to use `engine.installPath`.
- **Logo glitch** on "Iniciant..." overlay: switched from `logo.png` to `logo.svg` for
  crisp rendering at all resolutions without pixel artifacts.

### Changed

- **Installer pins**: `mlx-lm 0.30.7 → 0.31.2` and `mlx-vlm 0.1.27 → 0.4.4`
  (adds support for gemma4, qwen3_5_moe, qwen3_vl, llava_onevision, and the
  full modern VLM zoo). Side effect: `numpy 1.26 → 2.4` and `opencv 4.10 →
  4.13`. Full test suite rerun after upgrade: 4679 passed, zero regressions
  (the 11 pre-existing failures on readiness/i18n unchanged).
- **Knowledge base**: new "Multimodal models (VLM)" section in
  `knowledge/{ca,es,en}/LIMITATIONS.md` documenting supported architectures,
  detection heuristics, torch dependency requirements for omni-video models
  (Qwen3.5-MoE, Qwen3-Omni, Kimi-VL — NOT bundled in the DMG for size),
  recommended default `gemma-4-e4b-4bit` / `gemma-4-31b-8bit`, and current
  pipeline gaps (no audio, no native video, no VLM streaming yet).

### Tests

- +9 tests in `plugins/mlx_module/tests/test_multimodal.py` (12 → 21): new
  architectures, `vision_config` detector, safetensors weight-map detector,
  malformed JSON safety, `_generate_vlm` path + GenerationResult extraction.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-04-12

Multimodal VLM: suport d'imatges als 4 backends (Ollama, MLX, Llama.cpp, Web UI).

### Added

- **Multimodal images (Ollama)**: `OllamaChat._build_payload()` and `chat()` accept
  `images: Optional[List[str]]` (base64 strings). Passed through to Ollama `/api/chat`.
- **Multimodal images (MLX)**: `_detect_vlm_capability()` reads `config.json` to detect
  VLM architectures (Qwen2-VL, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, InternVL). `MLXChatNode._get_model()`
  bifurcates between `mlx_lm.load` (text) and `mlx_vlm.load` (VLM). New `_generate_vlm()`
  method uses `mlx_vlm.generate()` with `PIL.Image`.
- **Multimodal images (Llama.cpp)**: `mmproj_path` config field (env `LLAMA_MMPROJ_PATH`).
  `ModelPool` passes `clip_model_path` to `Llama()` when set. Graceful fallback: images
  ignored with warning if `mmproj_path` not configured.
- **Multimodal images (Web UI backend)**: `/ui/chat` endpoint validates `image_b64` +
  `image_type` (JPEG/PNG/WebP, max 10 MB). Passes `_images_arg` to all 3 engine call paths.
- **Camera button UI**: `#imageBtn` (camera icon), `#imagePreviewBar` (thumbnail strip),
  `#imageInput` (file picker, JPEG/PNG/WebP). `_handleImageSelect()` + `_clearSelectedImage()`.
  `sendMessage()` includes `image_b64` / `image_type` when image pending.
- **Dependency**: `mlx-vlm==0.1.27` added to installer (Apple Silicon). Compatible with
  `mlx-lm==0.30.7` and `transformers>=4.57`.
- **Tests**: 34 new multimodal tests across the 4 plugins (`test_multimodal.py`).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-12

Dependency: replace `sentence-transformers` + PyTorch (~600 MB) with `fastembed` (ONNX, ~50 MB).

### Changed

- **Embeddings backend**: `sentence-transformers` replaced by `fastembed` (ONNX runtime). Same
  model (`paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2`), same 768-dim vectors, same cosine similarity
  results. No change to Qdrant collections or stored vectors.
- **SSOT**: embedding model name centralised in `memory/embeddings/constants.py`
  (`DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL`). Change model in one place — `personality/server.toml` or
  `constants.py` — propagates everywhere.
- **Installer**: downloads fastembed model to `~/.cache/fastembed/` instead of HuggingFace cache.
- `requirements.txt`: `sentence-transformers>=4.0.0` → `fastembed>=0.3.6`

### Removed

- PyTorch (`torch`) transitive dependency — no longer pulled in by `sentence-transformers`.
  Saves ~600 MB from the install footprint.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-12

Security hardening: 4 P1 fixes from mega-consultoria 2026-04-11.

### Security fixes

- **P1-A** — Rate limit UI auth failures per IP. `make_require_ui_auth()` now
  tracks failed authentication attempts in a per-IP in-memory dict with a 60s
  sliding window. After 20 failures, returns `429 Too Many Requests`. Protects
  `/ui/*` endpoints against brute force. Dict-in-memory is intentional (no
  persistence needed between restarts; nexe 0.9.x is single-worker).
  Commit `6651848`.

- **P1-B** — Auth failures from the Web UI are now logged to the security log.
  Previously `make_require_ui_auth()` raised `401` without calling
  `security_logger.log_auth_failure()`, making brute force against `/ui/chat`
  invisible to SIEM/security monitoring. Now uses the same lazy-import pattern
  as `auth_dependencies.py:185-195`. Commit `293fd45`.

- **P1-C** — Symlink upload attack blocked. Attack vector: `ln -s /etc/passwd
  evil.pdf && curl -F "file=@evil.pdf"` ingested 17 chunks of `/etc/passwd`
  into `user_knowledge`. Fix: `_is_symlink_outside_uploads()` check via
  `os.path.realpath()` immediately after `save_file()`. If the saved path
  resolves outside the uploads directory, the file is deleted and a `400` is
  returned. Does NOT affect model symlinks (MLX/llama.cpp/Ollama never go
  through `/upload`). Commit `353e1f6`.

- **P1-D** — Encryption default changed from `false` to `auto`. Previously all
  sessions were stored in plain text by default, contradicting the
  "privacy-first" README. New behaviour: if `sqlcipher3` is available,
  encryption is auto-enabled at startup; if not, a `WARNING` is logged and the
  server continues in plain text. `NEXE_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=false` suppresses
  the warning. Existing plain-text data can be migrated with
  `nexe encryption encrypt-all`. Commit `a9970d7`.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-11

Consolidated release: Cirurgia Bloc 2 (2026-04-08) + Mega-consultoria hardening (2026-04-11).

### Security fixes (Mega-consultoria 2026-04-11)

Derived from a full security audit (mega-consultoria) with plan v2.4.

- **P0-1** — httpx split timeout for Ollama (chat + models). Previously a
  single 600s default meant Ollama hangs took up to 10 minutes to detect.
  Now `connect=5s` fails fast on a dead server, `read=600s` for chat
  (preserves thinking models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ), `read=60s` for
  models list/info/delete (fast operations). Env vars:
  `NEXE_OLLAMA_{CONNECT,READ,MODELS_READ,WRITE,POOL}_TIMEOUT`.
  Commit `61a72a3`.

- **P0-2** — llama_cpp_module ghost detection fixed. `/status` now reports
  `engines_available.llama_cpp` accurately. Three combined changes:
  - **P0-2.b** `core/lifespan_modules.py`: loader removes modules from
    `app.state.modules` when `initialize()` returns `False`. Also uses
    `list(plugin_modules.items())` to iterate safely while popping (avoids
    `RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration`). Commit `af32c2c`.
  - **P0-2.a** `plugins/llama_cpp_module/module.py`: `import llama_cpp`
    check at `initialize()` returns `False` immediately if the native lib
    is missing (no phantom routes). Commit `06d5000`.
  - **P0-2.c** `core/endpoints/root.py`: extracted `_check_llama_cpp_available(modules)`
    helper that verifies `_node is not None`, symmetric with the existing
    MLX check. Helper extraction enables unit testing without a real
    `starlette.Request` (slowapi's `@limiter.limit` rejects `MagicMock`).
    Commit `3cccd7f`.

- **P0-3** — Model switching concurrency: added short `asyncio.Lock()`
  around the `body.model` singleton mutation block in
  `routes_chat.py:_chat_inner`. Commit `7aa18cb`.

    **Design note**: server-nexe v0.9.x is architecturally single-user
    (uvicorn workers=1, class-level singletons `LlamaCppChatNode._pool`
    and `MLXChatNode._model`, in-process state, global
    `_chat_semaphore(2)`). The short lock is a **pragmatic mitigation**
    for the rare edge case of two concurrent requests racing to mutate
    the same singletons. For mono-user local usage the scenario is
    effectively never triggered. A full multi-user architecture refactor
    (multi-pool LRU cache + `config_override` per request + removal of
    class-level singletons + horizontal uvicorn workers) is **deferred**
    until multi-user becomes an actual use case. See the complete
    deferred-work scope documented in ISSUE-multiuser-refactor.md.

- **P1-1** — Jailbreak speed-bump: regex detector for common patterns
  (ca/en: "ignora instruccions", "you are now a/an WORD", "forget your
  rules", "DAN mode", "do anything now", etc.). Hooked after
  `validate_string_input` in `/ui/chat`. **Opció B**: injects a
  `[SECURITY NOTICE]` prefix instead of rejecting (400) to preserve UX on
  false positives. Pattern #3 (`you are now a|an \w+`) is deliberately
  tight to avoid false positives on conversational English ("you are now
  at home", "you are now free to go", etc.). Commit `f8b75b7`.

    **Note**: defense-in-depth only. Sophisticated attackers evade via
    Unicode lookalikes, base64/gzip encoding, chained prompts, language
    switching, etc. For real protection use content moderation at the
    model level.

- **P1-2** — Memory tag strip regex anchored to line start. Catches
  `[MEMORIA:]`, `[MEM:]`, `[SYSTEM:]`, `[USER:]`, `[ASSISTANT:]`,
  `[TOOL:]`, `[FUNCTION:]`, `[MEMORY:]` in addition to the original
  `[MEM_SAVE:]`. Newlines are preserved via capture group 1. Commit `4a91058`.

    **BREAKING** from v0.9.0 (documented inline in the updated tests):
    - Mid-line tags are NO longer stripped. Before: any occurrence of
      `[MEM_SAVE:...]` was stripped regardless of position. From 0.9.1:
      only tags at the start of a line (or after `\n`) are stripped.
      Rationale: reduce false positives on inline text like
      `"review this [USER: Jordi] part"`.
    - Empty tags like `[SYSTEM]` (no colon, no content) now match at
      line start. Closes a jailbreak vector where attackers use bare
      role tags.
    - Equals separator `[MEMORIA=value]` also matches (not only `:`).
    - Accepted tradeoff: `[memoria]` at the very start of a message
      IS stripped even when used as a normal word. Users can work
      around with any prefix.

- **P1-4** — Upload content denylist for sensitive patterns. Scans the
  first 8KB of each upload and rejects with HTTP 400 if a known pattern
  is found. Patterns are tuned to the real stack used by this project:
  - System: `root:x:0:0:` (most specific /etc/passwd signature)
  - PEM private keys: RSA, OpenSSH, PKCS8, EC, DSA, PGP
  - API tokens: `sk-ant-` (Anthropic / Claude Code), `sk-proj-` (OpenAI
    GPT / Codex CLI / Responses API), `ghp_` + `github_pat_` (GitHub
    PAT classic + fine-grained), `AIzaSy` (Google Gemini / AI Studio /
    Cloud / Firebase).

  Commit `145d742`.

    **Note**: speed-bump only, trivially bypassed by `gzip`, `base64`,
    `xor`, or any custom encoding. Protects against accidental drag&drop
    of sensitive files, not determined adversaries. Generic AWS patterns
    were explicitly NOT included — this project does not use AWS and a
    generic OWASP checklist would add noise without value.

### Cirurgia Bloc 2 — Security & Memory Pipeline (2026-04-08)

#### Fixed

- **Item 17 — MEM_SAVE bug**: `POST /v1/memory/store` was rejected by the Gate heuristic (`reason="model_generated"`) because `source="api"` mapped to `is_user_message=False` and `is_mem_save` was not passed. Fixed by passing `is_mem_save=True` — the store endpoint IS an explicit MEM_SAVE operation and should bypass the "model_generated" gate.
- **Item 21 — SQLCIPHER false sense of security**: `core/lifespan.py` declared "encryption ENABLED" without checking `SQLCIPHER_AVAILABLE`. If `sqlcipher3` was missing, sessions were encrypted but the `memories.db` database was not. Fixed with fail-closed behavior: server refuses to start with a clear `RuntimeError` if encryption is requested but `sqlcipher3` is not installed.

#### Security

- **Item 19 — Memory injection via direct API**: `POST /v1/chat/completions` did not apply `strip_memory_tags` to user messages, allowing `[MEM_SAVE: ...]` injection via the API while the Web UI was protected. Fixed.
- **Item 20 — Prompt injection via auto-ingest**: `core/ingest/ingest_knowledge.py` and `core/ingest/ingest_docs.py` did not apply `_filter_rag_injection` to document chunks before storing, while the upload UI path was protected. Fixed.

#### Changed

- **Item 22 — Workflows metadata honest**: `GET /v1/` metadata updated: `workflows.status` changed from `"implemented"` (false) to `"stub-v0.9.1"`. New `core/endpoints/workflows.py` router added that returns `501 Not Implemented` for any `/v1/workflows/*` path.
- **Item 24 — Pipeline unique enforced**: Removed 3 plugin chat endpoints that bypassed the canonical pipeline (`/mlx/chat`, `/llama-cpp/chat`, `/ollama/api/chat`). All chat must go through `/ui/chat` (canonical) or `/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compat). Item 23 (auth bypass) resolved by this removal.

### Deferred to 0.9.2+

- **P1-3** — Auth rate limiting (`TTLCache` + `NEXE_TRUST_PROXY`
  opt-in for `X-Forwarded-For` parsing). Only relevant when exposing
  server-nexe to the internet via a reverse proxy (Caddy, Traefik,
  Tailscale Funnel). For the current mono-user local deployment it is
  unnecessary. Trigger: decision to expose beyond localhost.

- **P0-3 full refactor** — Multi-pool LRU cache at `LlamaCppChatNode` +
  `MLXChatNode`, `config_override` parameter through
  `chat() → execute() → _get_model()`, `dataclasses.replace()` for
  immutable per-request configs, removal of class-level singletons,
  horizontal uvicorn workers, session manager migration.
  Trigger: multi-user becomes an actual use case.

- **QI-37 — Version string consolidation**: Resolved in commit `67242c9`
  (34 files synced to 0.9.1). Future: adopt single-source-of-truth pattern
  (e.g. `importlib.metadata.version("server-nexe")`).

### Known issues

- None. All pre-existing test failures resolved (commit `3e3dad7`:
  test_routes_lang_i18n synced with current_language assignment).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Memory v1** — Automatic fact extraction, semantic deduplication, dreaming (offline consolidation). 22 new files, ~4765 lines. Qdrant embedded, zero external processes.

- Security false positive tests (47 scenarios)

### Fixed

- Installer venv no longer depends on DMG mount path after ejection
- GPT-OSS thinking detection now works during streaming (not retroactively)
- SEC-002: MEM_SAVE tags stripped from user input before LLM processing
